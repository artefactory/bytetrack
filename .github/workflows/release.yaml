# This workflow triggers the CI, updates the version, and uploads the release to GitHub and
# Google Artifact Registry when a push is made to either the 'main' or 'develop' branch.
#
# Workflow Steps:
#
# 1. Ci is triggered using the CI workflow defined in .github/workflows/ci.yaml
# 2. If it succeeds, the version is updated using Python Semantic Release
# 3. The release is uploaded to PyPi (same step and GitHub action)
